# SVG-Tool
This tool allows you to take an SVG and calculates the Mathematical Equations of the Bézier Curves.

- It can generate for a single path or for all paths in the SVG
- It can also create an approximation using the Lagrange Interpolating Polynomial for a single path.
- You can get the Parametric or Implicit forms of The Math Equations of Curves.
- You can also generate a Bézier Curves from 4 Points or 8 Coefficients.
